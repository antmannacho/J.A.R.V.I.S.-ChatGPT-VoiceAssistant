# 🎙️ JarvisChatGPT

**JarvisChatGPT**, or **Jarvis**, is a state-of-the-art voice assistant powered by the same techonology as ChatGPT. It's built to be simple and conversational.

By default, Jarvis utilizes the **GPT-3.5-Turbo** model. However, if you fancy an upgrade, you can easily transition to **GPT-4** via the `main.py` file.

⚠️ **Important**: To harness the power of Jarvis, you'll need an **OpenAI API key**. Insert this key in the `apikey.py` file.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. **Setup Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. If not, [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Install Dependencies**: Simply run `install.bat`.
3. **Launch Jarvis**: Run `Run.bat`. Should you encounter any hiccups, dive into the troubleshooting section.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting
- **Initial Issues**: If `Run.bat` closes abruptly, manually open a terminal in the Jarvis directory and input:
  ``` shell
  python main.py
  ```
- **Installation Failures**: Facing issues with `install.bat`? Manually install the required packages:
  ``` shell
  python install pip
  ```
  Then run:
  ``` shell
  pip install openai SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio spotipy
  ```
- **Spotify Playback Errors**: Ensure you have an active Spotify session and check if you've entered correct Spotify credentials. Also, a premium account is a must-have or it won't work.
- **Mic Troubles**: Navigate to the control panel, access sound settings, select the recording tab, and set your mic as the default device.

## 📌 Key Features & Tips
- 🚫 Jarvis has **no token limit**. This means lengthier requests might have you twiddling your thumbs for a bit.
- 🛠️ Dive into `main.py` for customization options. Use `CTRL + F` and search for `system_prompt =` or `startswith("jarvis")` to swiftly locate and modify system prompts or wake word configurations.
- 🎤 For optimal performance, ensure the wake word, "Jarvis", starts your sentence.
- 🎵 Fancy some tunes? Remember, you need Spotify Premium for Jarvis's music features.
