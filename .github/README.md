# üéôÔ∏è JarvisChatGPT

**JarvisChatGPT**, or simply **Jarvis**, is your cutting-edge AI voice assistant, leveraging the sophisticated technology behind ChatGPT and OpenAI's API for a user experience that far surpasses conventional assistants like Siri or Alexa. It's designed to be both simple for casual interaction and powerful for more complex tasks, reminiscent of the Jarvis AI from popular films.

**Last Updated**: December 12th, 2023 (12-12-23)

**Important Update**: We've moved on from the old repository and shifted our focus to a significantly improved version, known as **M.I.L.E.S**. Although the original **JarvisChatGPT** repo is not actively updated, we're still committed to addressing any issues that arise, provided there isn't an available workaround. 

For a better, more refined AI voice assistant experience, especially tailored for Mac users, check out our new and enhanced repository:

This latest version promises an enhanced performance with an installation process that is notably straightforward on MacOS. Windows users, please be informed that while support exists, the installation process can be significantly more challenging and might not succeed in every case. We primarily recommend this for Mac users, though Windows users willing to navigate the complexities are welcome to try.

**OS Support**: Optimized for MacOS. Windows compatibility exists but with potential installation challenges.

By default, Jarvis utilizes the **GPT-3.5-Turbo** API model. However, if you fancy an upgrade, you can easily transition to **GPT-4** via the `main.py` file.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: To harness the power of Jarvis, you'll need an **OpenAI API key**. Insert this key in the `apikey.py` file.

## üöÄ Quick Start
1. **Setup Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. If not, [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Install Dependencies**: Simply run `install.bat`.
3. **Launch Jarvis**: Run `Run.bat`. Should you encounter any hiccups, dive into the troubleshooting section.
4. **Have Fun!**

  ``` shell
  python main.py
  ```
- **Installation Failures**: Facing issues with `install.bat`? Manually install the required packages:
  ``` shell
  python install pip
  ```
  Then run:
  ``` shell
  pip install openai==0.28.1 SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio spotipy
  ```
- **Spotify Playback Errors**: Ensure you have an active Spotify session and check if you've entered correct Spotify credentials. Also, a premium account is a must-have or it won't work.
- **Mic Troubles**: Navigate to the control panel, access sound settings, select the recording tab, and set your mic as the default device.
